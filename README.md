# OutlookPopup
Example console project that uses the older Outlook assemblies to popup an Outlook email window.

Look at the comments to replace machine specific values.
Most likely need to replace the path to the executable, the recipient email addresses, and the paths to attachments.

This project is dependent on Outlook being installed on the executing machine.
